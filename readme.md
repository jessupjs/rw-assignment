## Redfield & Wilton Application Assignment

Jared Jessup

### Setup
1. No-framework vanilla HTML / CSS / JS (w d3.js library exception).
2. No-backend (queries and server-side preprocessing represented in frontend).

### Notes
1. From `USA Full Data Tables 12.08.2020.xlsx` topically relevant rows extracted for column header only format, stored in `vis_extracts.csv` (similar to stadard model setup).
2. Data loaded and filtered in `main.js` (not all data related to a question series are included).

#### Data
1. All data located in `vis_extracts.csv` (taken from tab 'US Full Results 12.08.2020').

#### Todos
1. Make a clear checkpoint connection between narrative content and data.
2. Decide if use case requires db (data load is light; client can handle preprocessing; no cms template; no peripheral api needs).
