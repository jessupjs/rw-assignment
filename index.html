                    confidence now and towards the November presidential election.</h2>
                <p>After months of wading the coronavirus info stream, many Americans have self-constructed their
                    own safety measures. We surveyed individuals from different demographics, including age, gender,
                    region and political lean, in order to better understand how people feel about being present in
                    commonly peopled places. Though still months away from the election, we also peered into a possible
                    scenario at polling stations.</p>

                <p>More than in any other activity we surveyed, results indicate that people feel relatively safe
                    venturing outdoors. Can simply stepping outside be considered a social exercise? It may depend on
                    whether you live on a 'block' or on a 'street' (the classic urban/rural debate).</p>

                    interestingly in the population dense North East, higher numbers may indicate that some feel the
